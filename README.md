**MobPVP** transforms your Minecraft survival experience by assigning levels to every living creature in the game. Based on these levels, mobs gain different abilities, attributes, and loot chances, creating a more challenging and rewarding combat system.

## About

Welcome to MobPvP, a mod that offers tools and blocks for PvP, PvE, Combat, and Progression.

Important: To view all required recipes in MobPvP, consider installing JEI. The vanilla recipe book will not fully guide you.
